# Incident Classification with R

This folder contains example R scripts for automatically classifying support tickets.

## Files

- `incident_classification.R` – base script that generates a sample dataset, trains a decision tree and performs simple clustering.
- `incident_classification_advanced.R` – extended version including additional features and a random forest with cross-validation, as well as hierarchical clustering.

## Running the scripts

Use `Rscript` to execute a file, for example:

```bash
Rscript incident_classification.R
```

The scripts generate a synthetic dataset so no external data is required.
